# **About This Project**

I began my journey with Python in 2021, using it as a calculator during my Math 215 course on linear algebra. My programming skills deepened in 2022 when I started the Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis (ACME) Junior Core classes at Brigham Young University (BYU). During this time, I learned to work with Git, Linux, and more complex Python coding techniques.

Since then, I've developed some projects that I'm excited to share:

- Music Prediction Project (to be added soon): In this project, I applied time series analysis to predict musical trends using ARIMA, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Meta's Prophet. It's a deep dive into the intersection of data science and music. This project was a collaboration with my friend and classmate Michelle Wang.

- Ad Bot: This project uses Markov chains to generate advertisements, but in a way that is reminicent of pre-Chat GPT chatbots. It pulls from a dataset of nearly 2,000 commercial scripts to create its *unique* content. Data was found from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kevinhartman0/advertisement-transcripts-from-various-industries. Here's an example "Ad" script:

  > Ever skied the web and analyzes the European capital cities. Experience light you used car. Have a successful career takes care that isle with ridges to global scale. Look for quality, undeniably luxurious,and unbelievably reliable.That's Acura SLX. The leader and Bloomingdale's.

- Knitting Calculator: A handy tool I created to help me calculate the correct sizing for knitting projects. It takes into account different factors to provide accurate results.

- Ising Modeling with MCMC: this project combines the Metropolis Hastings Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with thermodynamic simulations. I started my explorations of this idea in my mathematical modeling class and had a chance to expand on this in my Statistical Mechanics Thermodynamic class, when we talked about the Ising model. This model is a 2D model can simulate molecules in phase transitions and charges of atoms in ferromagnetism. I was able to simulate a MCMC Ising model in Python to explore how MCMC works, and then directly simulate it in a Mathematica noteboo

These projects reflect my ongoing journey in learning and applying Python to real-world challenges, and I hope you find them as intriguing as I do.
