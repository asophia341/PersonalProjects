# **About This Project**

I began my journey with Python in 2021, using it as a calculator during my Math 215 course on linear algebra. My programming skills deepened in 2022 when I started the Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis (ACME) Junior Core classes at Brigham Young University (BYU). During this time, I learned to work with Git, Linux, and more complex Python coding techniques.

Since then, I've developed some projects that I'm excited to share:

- Music Prediction Project: In this project, I applied time series analysis to predict musical trends using ARIMA, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Meta's Prophet. It's a deep dive into the intersection of data science and music. This project was a collaboration with my friend and classmate Michelle Wang.

- Ad Bot: This project uses Markov chains to generate advertisements, but in a way that is reminicent of pre-Chat GPT chatbots. It pulls from a dataset of nearly 2,000 commercial scripts to create its *unique* content.

- Knitting Calculator: A handy tool I created to help me calculate the correct sizing for knitting projects. It takes into account different factors to provide accurate results.

These projects reflect my ongoing journey in learning and applying Python to real-world challenges, and I hope you find them as intriguing as I do.
